                    The vision of a comparison engine for data analysis has developed over many years
                    starting with a <a href="http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/83/20130048" target="_blank">paper</a>
                    in Royal Society Interface. The engine behind this website is based around our work
                    on time-series analysis, which is described below.
                </p>
                <h3>The software</h3>
                <p>
                    The engine underlying this website is based on software for performing highly comparative
                    time-series analysis called hctsa (highly comparative time-series analysis). This Matlab-based
                    software allows users to apply and compare the performance of thousands of scientific time-series
                    analysis methods on their data and is freely-available for non-commercial use on
                    <a href="https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa" target="_blank">github</a>, and is accompanied by comprehensive
                    online documentation on <a href="https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/hctsa-users/hctsa-manual/details" target="_blank">gitbook</a>
                    and a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2017.10.001" target="_blank">journal article</a>. 
                </p>

                <h3>The results</h3>
                <p>
                    <em>hctsa</em> has been used for a wide range of real-world problems involving time-series data, spanning precision
                    medicine to financial analytics. Successful applications include:

                <h3>How CompEngine works</h3>
                <p>
                    Our research has suggested that real-world time series can be represented compactly using a small set of numbers,
                    called features, that capture their important properties. When you upload time-series data to CompEngine, we
                    compute these features from your data, and use them to find other time series, already in our library, that have
                    similar feature values. We hope to improve this feature set over time to give the best possible matches.

                <h3 id="feature-set">The CompEngine feature set</h3>
                <p>
                    The current set of 16 features was taken from our time-series analysis software package,
                    <a href="https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa" target="_blank">hctsa <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>,
                    as a set that performs well on diverse time-series classification tasks and includes a diverse range of behaviors.
                    The feature set used to retrieve neighbors in CompEngine can be grouped crudely as measuring: <em><b>autocorrelation</b></em>
                    (CO_Embed2_Basic_tau_incircle_1, CO_Embed2_Basic_tau_incircle_2, AC_9, CO_FirstMin_ac, CO_trev_1_num, SB_MotifTwo_mean_hhh,
                    PH_Walker_prop_01_sw_propcross) and <em><b>predictability</b></em> (FC_LocalSimple_mean1_taures, FC_LocalSimple_lfit_taures,
                    EN_SampEn_5_03_sampen1), <em><b>stationarity</b></em> (SY_StdNthDer_1, SY_SpreadRandomLocal_50_100_meantaul,
                    SY_SpreadRandomLocal_ac2_100_meantaul), <em><b>distribution</b></em> (DN_HistogramMode_10, DN_OutlierInclude_abs_001_mdrmd),
                    and <em><b>scaling</b></em> (SC_FluctAnal_2_rsrangefit_50_1_logi_prop_r1).
                    If youâ€™re interested in the specific algorithmic implementations of these features, the names of features
                    given in parentheses in the list above can be matched to features in our software package,
                    <a href="https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa" target="_blank">hctsa <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>.
