                        Welcome to Comp-Engine Time Series, a comparison engine for time-series data!
                        This website allows you to upload time-series data and interactively visualize
                        how your data relates to time series that others have measured or generated.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How it works:</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you upload new time-series data, our servers compute properties (or ‘features’)
                        of the data, and use these features to find similar types of data that are already
                        in our database. You can then interactively explore how your data is placed in this
                        broader context—maybe you’ll find a new connection or get a new idea <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>?!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Objectives:</h3>
                    <p>
                        We want CompEngine Time Series to be a place where you can contribute to a self-organizing,
                        living library of time-series data. Our main objectives are twofold:
                    </p>

                        <b>1. Tie together diverse disciplines <i class="fa fa-link"></i></b><br />
                            Time-series data are generated across the sciences and industry: heart rates measured
                            during surgery <i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i>, chaotic laser bursts measured in physics
                            laboratories <i class="fa fa-bolt"></i>, sensors on industrial production lines
                            <i class="fa fa-industry"></i>, vast records of credit card transactions
                            <i class="fa fa-credit-card"></i>, archaeological timelines <i class="fa fa-history"></i>,
                            and medieval music scores <i class="fa fa-music"></i>. All of these data can be represented
                            as time series, and yet they are seldom collected and analyzed together. By uploading your
                            own data to CompEngine, you can learn about similar data measured and analyzed in other parts
                            of science and industry. It can directly connect you to others who have uploaded similar data
                            from another area and even help identify appropriate classes of mathematical models for your
                            data. We hope that doing so will enable a discipline-fluid view of time-series analysis that
                            might spark exciting new discussion and collaboration.

                        <b>2. Design useful methods for time-series data <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i></b><br />
                        In order to design useful methods for time-series data, we first need to survey the types of
                        time-series that we measure from the world, and understand which methods work best on which
                        types of data. We make <a href="/#!download">all uploaded data available for anyone to download and study</a>,
                        in the hope that this will stimulate a new generation of time-series analysis algorithms that are properly
                        tailored to the diversity of real data.
